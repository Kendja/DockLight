# DockLight
This programm shows a simple Dock Panel with window preview.

Docklight” is a simple but effective dock launcher for GNOME 3 desktops e.g (cinnamon).
It supports a Preview from all open Applications witch is a feature than I can’t found I other similar docks.

The “DockLight” preview allows more control over the opened windows and can navigate to a specific window much easier.
Select the window or close the desired application the real time preview make that very easy.
“Docklight” is written in C++ with “GTK 3” and “libmnck”. “Docklight” is open source width a GNU General Public License.
